# Weather Viewer

## Goals
Query the Yahoo API for weather data and display forecast for the next 10 days. This app aims to do the following 6 things:

[] Allow a user to select from a list of U.S. cities (selection should be "sticky" meaning selection persists between browser sessions)
[x] Show the current weather for user-selected city using the Yahoo Weather API https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/
[x] Should also show weather for the next 10 days
[x] For each day (current and next 10 days) display the following:
  - The date (e.g. "Monday, November 21st, 2016")
  - High temp
  - Low temp
  - Description (e.g. "Partly Cloudy")
[x]. Make app responsive/adaptive:  on a mobile phone, weather for next 10 days (boxes/tiles) should be stacked in portrait orientation (365px X 667px) and horizontal layout in landscape orientation
